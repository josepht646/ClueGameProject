Legend Testing:
We decided to test the entire legend.

Door Direction Testing:
We tested a door in each direction.
The Bank Vault has a door that opens up.
The Cave has a door that opens right.
The Lake has a door that opens down.
The Attic has a door that opens left.
We tested that a cell in a room (Dumbwaiter) was not a door.
We also tested to make sure the Walkway was not a door.

Number of doorways:
We tested that the total number of doorways was
equal to the number of doorways in our CSV file
(12 in our case).

Room initial test:
We decided to test the corners of our board
to both ensure the correct room label assignment
and that the entire board was read into the Set.
We also tested random cells in our board to make
sure that they corresponded to the correct room label.
